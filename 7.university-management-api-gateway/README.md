# University Management API Gateway

### What I've Learned:

- Setting up a Node.js project structure.
- Creating a robust API Gateway using Express.js.
- Implementing proxy routes to route requests to um-auth and um-core services.
- Handling authentication and core functionalities seamlessly.
- Understanding best practices in API Gateway development.

### Technologies Used:

- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js that makes building APIs and web applications a breeze.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows you to build scalable network applications.
- Redis: An open-source, in-memory data store used for caching and session management.
- Multer: Middleware for handling file uploads in Node.js applications.
- Cloudinary: A cloud-based media management solution for storing, managing, and delivering images and videos.

### Why This Project Matters:

API Gateways are critical components in modern web development, enabling efficient and secure communication between various microservices and clients. This project not only teaches you valuable skills but also provides you with a practical application of those skills in a real-world scenario.
